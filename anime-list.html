        <p>Moments prior to Naruto Uzumaki's birth, a huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-Tailed Fox, attacked
         Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, and wreaked havoc. In order to put an end to the Kyuubi's rampage,
          the leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life and sealed the monstrous beast inside 
          the newborn Naruto. Now, Naruto is a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja still living in Konohagakure.
           Shunned because of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place in the village, while his 
           burning desire to become the Hokage of Konohagakure leads him not only to some great new friends,
            but also some deadly foes.</p>

        <p>Gold Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line.
           The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world.
            His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece.
           It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which
            promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the
             Pirate King. Enter Monkey Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate.
              Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun,
               Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that
                leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps 
                of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures,
                 unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all
                  fortunes—One Piece. </p>

         <p>Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans,
          forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying
           is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure.
            To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting
             in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered
              when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight 
              for survival against the man-eating abominations. After witnessing a horrific personal loss at the
               hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting
                into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the
                 protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows
                  Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert,
                   as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them 
                   before the last walls are breached.</p>

         <p>A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they see their victim's face and write their victim's name in a notebook called a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the shinigami lifestyle and interested in seeing how a human would use a Death Note, drops one into the human realm. High school student and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the Death Note and—since he deplores the state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by writing a criminal's name in it. When the criminal dies immediately following his experiment with the Death Note, Light is greatly surprised and quickly recognizes how devastating the power that has fallen into his hands could be. With this divine capability, Light decides to extinguish all criminals in order to build a new world where crime does not exist and people worship him as a god. Police, however, quickly discover that a serial killer is targeting criminals and, consequently, try to apprehend the culprit. To do this, the Japanese investigators count on the assistance of the best detective in the world: a young and eccentric man known only by the name of L.</p>

         <p>"In order for something to be obtained, something of equal value must be lost." Alchemy is bound by this Law
          of Equivalent Exchange—something the young brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric only realize after attempting
           human transmutation: the one forbidden act of alchemy. They pay a terrible price for their transgression—Edward 
           loses his left leg, Alphonse his physical body. It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edward's right arm that 
           he is able to affix Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both
            eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called
             "automail" and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist. Three years of searching later,
              the brothers seek the Philosopher's Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law
               of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye,
                and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide
                 conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosopher's Stone, but their country's
                  murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask 
                  themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.</p>

         <p>In the year 2022, virtual reality has progressed by leaps and bounds, and a massive online role-playing
          game called Sword Art Online (SAO) is launched. With the aid of "NerveGear" technology, players can control
           their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts. Kazuto Kirigaya, nicknamed "Kirito,"
            is among the lucky few enthusiasts who get their hands on the first shipment of the game. He logs in to
             find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad, one full of fantastic
              medieval weapons and gruesome monsters. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they
               cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred 
               levels of the game. In order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his 
               fellow players. Some are allies, while others are foes, like Asuna Yuuki, who commands the leading group 
               attempting to escape from the ruthless game. To make matters worse, Sword Art Online is not all fun and 
               games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt to his new reality, fight for his
                survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.</p>

          <p>The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, has been steadily increasing over the years,
           with 80 percent of humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation of elements to shapeshifting.
            This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such individual.
             Since he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to be a hero.
              Izuku's unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it seems that
               his persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal idol, All Might.
                All Might's quirk is a unique ability that can be inherited, and he has chosen Izuku to be his successor!
                 Enduring many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in UA High, a prestigious high school famous for
                  its excellent hero training program, and this year's freshmen look especially promising. With his bizarre
                   but talented classmates and the looming threat of a villainous organization, Izuku will soon learn what
                    it really means to be a hero.</p>

         <p>Young Ciel Phantomhive is known as "the Queen's Guard Dog," taking care of the many unsettling events
          that occur in Victorian England for Her Majesty. Aided by Sebastian Michaelis, his loyal butler with seemingly 
          inhuman abilities, Ciel uses whatever means necessary to get the job done. But is there more to this black-clad 
          butler than meets the eye? In Ciel's past lies a secret tragedy that enveloped him in perennial darkness—during
           one of his bleakest moments, he formed a contract with Sebastian, a demon, bargaining his soul in exchange for
            vengeance upon those who wronged him. Today, not only is Sebastian one hell of a butler, but he is also the 
            perfect servant to carry out his master's orders—all the while anticipating the delicious meal he will 
            eventually make of Ciel's soul. As the two work to unravel the mystery behind Ciel's chain of misfortunes,
             a bond forms between them that neither heaven nor hell can tear apart.</p>

         <p>After death, there is no heaven or hell, only a bar that stands between reincarnation and oblivion.
          There the attendant will, one after another, challenge pairs of the recently deceased to a random game in
           which their fate of either ascending into reincarnation or falling into the void will be wagered.
           Whether it's bowling, darts, air hockey, or anything in between, each person's true nature will be 
           revealed in a ghastly parade of death and memories, dancing to the whims of the bar's master.
            Welcome to Quindecim, where Decim, arbiter of the afterlife, awaits! Death Parade expands upon the 
            original one-shot intended to train young animators. It follows yet more people receiving judgment—until 
            a strange, black-haired guest causes Decim to begin questioning his own rulings.</p>

         <p>The self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe rents out a room in a rickety old building in Akihabara, 
         where he indulges himself in his hobby of inventing prospective "future gadgets" with fellow 
         lab members: Mayuri Shiina, his air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, a perverted hacker
          nicknamed "Daru." The three pass the time by tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, 
          a machine dubbed the "Phone Microwave," which performs the strange function of morphing bananas into 
          piles of green gel. Though miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in 
          Okabe's search for a scientific breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action 
          by a string of mysterious happenings before stumbling upon an unexpected success—the Phone Microwave can
           send emails to the past, altering the flow of history. Adapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel
            by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate takes Okabe through the depths of scientific theory and practicality.
             Forced across the diverging threads of past and present, Okabe must shoulder the burdens that come with
              holding the key to the realm of time.</p>
